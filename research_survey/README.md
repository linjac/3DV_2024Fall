# Research Survey

### Deadline
Oct. 6 (Sun), 23:59 Central time

### Description
You will select a topic to explore with a small group ([group assignment](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13k0lSy2hW_7RG9Mm4kHxvpYBVJUcWZOPA4CGiIt7KIk/edit?gid=1544578260#gid=1544578260)), perform a literature review, and write a survey (4 pages) that includes a taxonomy of key design decisions and techniques, a summary of evaluations, an assessment of current capabilities and gaps, and the identification of new research ideas. Each survey will be submitted to the class Github repo and shared with everyone. Topics: The topic of a survey can be exactly the same as the lecture topic (e.g., SLAM) or narrower (e.g., Dense V-SLAM). Each survey is expected to cover at least 20 papers on the chosen topic. The survey could later serve as inspiration for selecting research problems and ideas. That being said, the survey group and the final project group can be different.
